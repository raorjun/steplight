# StepLight
This project aims to create a wearable object detection system using machine learning and computer vision. 
It will leverage the Coral Dev Board’s TPU for efficient inference, coupled with OpenCV to classify objects 
such as "Cross" vs. "Don’t Cross" for real-time decision-making.
## Authors
Arjun Rao & Armaan Gera
## Libraries and Equipment
- TensorFlow - A machine learning library that is used to train and run models. 
We use this library to export our model to a .tflite file and run it on the Google Coral Dev Board.
- OpenCV - A computer vision library that is used to process images and video.
- Flutter - A UI toolkit that is used to create the mobile app that interacts with our wearable solution
via Wifi/Bluetooth.
- Google Coral Dev Board - A computer with a Mendel Linux OS that is used to run our machine learning model.
- Arducam 5MP Wide Angle Camera - The camera that is used in our wearable solution.
